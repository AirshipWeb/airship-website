        Airship is a collection of loosely coupled but interoperable open source
        tools that declaratively automate cloud provisioning. Airship is a
        robust delivery mechanism for organizations who want to embrace
        containers as the new unit of infrastructure delivery at scale. Starting
        from raw bare metal infrastructure, Airship manages the full lifecycle
        of data center infrastructure to deliver a production-grade Kubernetes
        cluster with Helm deployed artifacts. Airship allows operators to manage
        their infrastructure deployments and lifecycle through the declarative
        YAML documents that describe an Airship environment.

        Infrastructure is managed through declarative YAML files and there is
        one workflow for both  deployments and updates. Airship does not require
        operators to develop their own set of complex  orchestration tooling to
        automate Airship.

        Kubernetes resources (native resources and CustomResources) are the
        basic unit of deployment for all software, allowing for simple
        integration with best-in-class tooling and Kubernetes operators.
        Expanding the software stack is as  simple as adding new resources to
        Airship declarations.

        Platform state including all versions are specified declaratively, and
        Airship, Helm, and Kubernetes  align containers, dependencies, and
        configuration in the same way every time.

        All jobs and services are running as containers, provide health status,
        and are healed by Kubernetes  supervision by taking full advantage of
        native Kubernetes resiliency.
      title: Resilient
    - image: /img/self_hosted.svg
      text: >-
        Airship deploys its provisioning control plane and operators in a
        self-hosted manner. This allows them to be upgraded like any other
        software component in the system.
