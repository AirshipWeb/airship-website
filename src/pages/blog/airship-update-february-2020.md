## **AIRSHIP BLOG**

The Airship blog is a great way to keep up with what's going on in the community. The Airship community publishes
[*blog posts*](https://www.airshipit.org/blog/) regularly, including the recent Airship 2.0 Blog series. These blog
posts introduce the changes from Airship 1.0 to Airship 2.0, highlight new features, and detail the evolution of each
component. The first six Airship 2.0 Blog posts are already available:

- [*Airship Blog Series 1 - Evolution Towards 2.0*](
  https://www.airshipit.org/blog/pre-alpha-airship-blog-series-1-evolution-towards-2.0.html)
- [*Airship Blog Series 2 - An Educated Evolution*](

## **AIRSHIP 2: THE SEQUEL**

Recently Ryan van Wyk narrated a great, short, video discussing Airship - and the evolution to Airship2.  It's a must
see for anyone interested in Airship:

## **JIRA MIGRATION TO GITHUB ISSUES**
The Airship Community is embracing [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/airshipit/airshipctl/issues) for tracking Airship
scope. Among the many benefits of [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/airshipit/airshipctl/issues) are:
- Anyone can create issues.
- Ease of communication between community members on issues.
- Intuitive labels allowing contributors to find specific categories of issues easily such as:
    - "Good first issue" for new contributors to Airship 2.0.
    - "component/`<componentName>`" for developers looking to work on specific components such as the config module.

To date 43 issues have been created, and 9 of them have been completed already. Join us each week on the [Airship
Flight Plan](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Airship#AIRSHIP_Flight_Plan_-_Community_Management_Meetings) call to groom
and discuss issues that the community is working on.

The call is on Wednesdays, from 16:00-17:00 UTC on [WebEx](
https://attcorp.webex.com/attcorp/j.php?MTID=m601b443aab0cf49ee8b75401dd6e1649) and the agenda/notes can be found in the
[etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/Airship_FlightPlan).

Note that the [Jira Board](https://airship.atlassian.net/projects/AIR/issues) will be retired as part of this migration,
and that the relevant Jira issues have been migrated to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/airshipit/airshipctl/issues).
