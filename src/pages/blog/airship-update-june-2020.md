Committee.<!-- more -->

## **AIRSHIP BLOG**

The Airship blog is a great way to keep up with what's going on in the community. The Airship community publishes
[*blog posts*](https://www.airshipit.org/blog/) regularly, including the recent Airship 2.0 Blog series. These blog
posts introduce the changes from Airship 1.0 to Airship 2.0, highlight new features, and detail the evolution of each
component. The first six Airship 2.0 Blog posts are already available, and illustrate the design thoughts on the road to
the alpha milestone:

- [*Airship Blog Series 1 - Evolution Towards 2.0*](
  https://www.airshipit.org/blog/airship-blog-series-1-evolution-towards-2.0.html)
- [*Airship Blog Series 2 - An Educated Evolution*](
   https://www.airshipit.org/blog/airship-blog-series-2-an-educated-evolution.html)
- [*Airship Blog Series 3 - Airship 2.0 Architecture High Level*](
   https://www.airshipit.org/blog/airship-blog-series-3-airship-2.0-architecture-high-level.html)
- [*Airship Blog Series 4 - Shipyard - an Evolution of the Front Door*](
   https://www.airshipit.org/blog/airship-blog-series-4-shipyard-an-evolution-of-the-front-door.html)
- [*Airship Blog Series 5 - Drydock and Its Relationship to Cluster API*](
  https://www.airshipit.org/blog/airship-blog-series-5-drydock-and-its-relationship-to-cluster-api.html)
- [*Airship Blog Series 6 - Armada Growing Pains*](

Stay tuned for more exciting news on the Airship blog series as Airship2.0 progresses through the beta milestone and
beyond!

## **JUNE VIRTUAL PTG**

On 04-05 June Airship participated in the OSF hosted Virtual PTG. The PTG facilitated productive cross-team
collaborations with StarlingX, Ironic and the Edge Working Group. Feed back has been very positive, what follows is a
summary of the PTG:

In general the attendees were satisfied with the times selected striking a good balance across timezones, between
virtual and PTG. Most attendees were also in favor of the focused 2 day PTG that did not require full focus for an
entire week.

Conversations with Starling-X included an update on Airship2.0, and laid out the deprecation cycle for Armada, an
Airship project being leveraged by Starling-X which is not being developed further in Airship2.0, for more details see
this [*blog post*](https://www.airshipit.org/blog/airship-blog-series-6-armada-growing-pains.html). We are encouraging
the Starling-X community to check out the Flux Helm Operator which will be replacing Armada in Airship2.0

There was Airship representation at the Edge Working group, to provide an update on Airship 2.0 and how it targets
various edge computing use cases.

Airship worked closely with the OpenStack-Helm team with a focus on code review and working through security scope.

Representing the Airship community was Noor from Dell at the Ironic sessions. These sessions highlighted some potential
future paths forward with vendor variations of Redfish.

The planned agenda, [*here*](https://etherpad.opendev.org/p/airship-virtual-ptg-2020) was a perfect fit for the allotted
time.

## **AIRSHIP USER SURVEY**

If you are evaluating or running Airship, share your feedback in the [*Airship User Survey*](
https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/YKZ9NC2)! This survey provides users an opportunity to provide anonymous feedback to
influence the community and software direction. By sharing information about your configuration and requirements, the
Airship Working Committee will be able to advocate on your behalf. The 2020 survey results will be presented at the Fall
Summit, November, 2020. Take the [*Airship User Survey*](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/YKZ9NC2) to be included in this
round of analysis.

## **AIRSHIP TECHNICAL COMMITTEE ELECTION**

The Airship community adopted formal [*governance*](https://opendev.org/airship/governance) in 2019 leading to the
creation of two committees responsible for helping to guide Airship projects. Each of these committees is elected by
the community to serve for one year at a time.

Over the next two weeks the Working Committee is organizing an election to fill all 5 seats for the 2020-2021 Technical
Committee term. Earlier today the first phase, nominations, began and was announced via the mailing list which you can
subscribe to [*here*](http://lists.airshipit.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo).

Anyone who has demonstrated a commitment to Airship (community building, communications, or had code merged to the
Airship project repositories) within the last 12 months is eligible to run for the Technical Committee. Anyone who is a
Contributor (someone who has had changes merged within the last 12 months to any Airship project repository) before the
election will be eligible to vote for the TC candidates. There are no term limits, but in order to encourage diversity,
no more than 2 of the 5 seats can be filled by any one organization. The Technical Committee will meet regularly in an
open forum with times and locations published in community channels.

For more details for eligibility, responsibilities, and election processes please see the [*Airship Governance*](
https://opendev.org/airship/governance).

## **UPCOMING AIRSHIP WORKING COMMITTEE ELECTION**

Next month, in July, the current Working Committee term will end, and elections to fill all 5 seats for the 2020-2021
Technical Committee term will be held.

Anyone who has had changes merged within the last 12 months to an Airship project is eligible to run for the Working
Committee. Anyone who is a Core Reviewer of any Airship Project before the election will be eligible to vote for the WC
candidates. There are no term limits, but in order to encourage diversity, no more than 2 of the 5 seats can be filled
by any one organization. The Working Committee will meet regularly in an open forum with times and locations published
in community channels.

For more details for eligibility, responsibilities, and election processes please see the [*Airship Governance*](
