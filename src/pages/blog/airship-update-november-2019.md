## **AIRSHIP BLOG**

The Airship blog is a great way to keep up with what's going on in the community. The Airship community publishes
[*blog posts*](https://www.airshipit.org/blog/) regularly, including the recent Airship 2.0 Blog series. These blog
posts introduce the changes from Airship 1.0 to Airship 2.0, highlight new features, and detail the evolution of each
component. The first six Airship 2.0 Blog posts are already available:

_**UPDATE 03-August-2020:** Airship 2.0 development spans multiple milestones. Upon completing the first major
milestone, Alpha, the community took some time to reflect on lessons learned and how they impacted the direction and
design of Airship 2.0. We have summarized these lessons learned and how the design has changed over time - including
using different technologies and approaches. You can read more about these changes here: [Airship 2.0 is Alpha - Lessons
Learned](https://www.airshipit.org/blog/airship2-is-alpha/). We recommend reviewing these changes before reading blogs
marked as "Pre-Alpha."_
