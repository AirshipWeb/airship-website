**Project Teams Gathering:**

Many contributors are also actively planning to participate at the virtual [Project Teams Gathering](https://www.openstack.org/ptg) (PTG) event that will be held from Monday, October 26 to Friday, October 30. PTGs, organized by the OpenStack Foundation, allow various technical community groups working on open infrastructure projects to exchange ideas and get work done in a productive setting. As usual, teams in attendance will discuss and plan their upcoming releases. 

[PTG registration is now open!](https://october2020ptg.eventbrite.com) Similar to the last PTG in June, it is free, and we will again be using email to communicate details about the event (schedules, passwords, etc), so please register! You can follow the planning if you are interested in attending, see more details [here](https://www.openstack.org/ptg).
