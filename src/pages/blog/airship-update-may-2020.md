Committee.<!-- more -->

## **SPOTLIGHT ON ....**

- Learn how Airship 2.0, targeted for delivery later this year, is solving NFVi challenges on the way to full 5G
  deployment in this [*white paper*](https://www.airshipit.org/blog/airship2-whitepaper/) authored by VP of AT&T's
  Network Cloud: Ryan van Wyk, and Airship architects: Alan Meadows and Rodolfo Pacheco.
- On 06-May-2020 Airship 2.0's alpha milestone was declared complete. This was a significant step towards getting
  Airship 2.0 production-ready, and would not have been possible without the hard work from all of our talented
  developers, the valuable input from all of our community members, and the collaboration across the projects that
  Airship 2 will leverage. Thank you all for your contributions!

## **AIRSHIP BLOG**

The Airship blog is a great way to keep up with what's going on in the community. The Airship community publishes
[*blog posts*](https://www.airshipit.org/blog/) regularly, including the recent Airship 2.0 Blog series. These blog
posts introduce the changes from Airship 1.0 to Airship 2.0, highlight new features, and detail the evolution of each
component. The first six Airship 2.0 Blog posts are already available:

_**UPDATE 03-August-2020:** Airship 2.0 development spans multiple milestones. Upon completing the first major
milestone, Alpha, the community took some time to reflect on lessons learned and how they impacted the direction and
design of Airship 2.0. We have summarized these lessons learned and how the design has changed over time - including
using different technologies and approaches. You can read more about these changes here: [Airship 2.0 is Alpha - Lessons
Learned](https://www.airshipit.org/blog/airship2-is-alpha/). We recommend reviewing these changes before reading blogs
marked as "Pre-Alpha."_

## **UPCOMING VIRTUAL PTG**

The OpenStack Foundation is holding a Virtual Project Teams Gathering (PTG) 01-05 June. The event is free with
registration [*here*](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/virtual-project-teams-gathering-june-2020-tickets-103456996662).

The Project Teams Gathering (PTG) is an event organized by the OpenStack Foundation. It provides meeting facilities
allowing the various technical community groups working with OpenStack (user workgroups, development teams, operators,
SIGs) to meet in-person, exchange and get work done in a productive setting. It lets those various groups discuss their
priorities for the upcoming cycle, assign work items, iterate quickly on solutions for complex problems, and make fast
progress on critical issues. The co-location of those various meetings, combined with the dynamic scheduling of the
event, make it easy to get specific people in the same room to discuss a specific topic, or participate in multiple team
meetings. Evenings allow for relationship building and problem sharing.

The list of groups attending and their planned sessions are available on this [*calendar*](
https://object-storage-ca-ymq-1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/www-assets-prod/ptg/PTG2020-Schedule.pdf).

The Airship sessions will be in one-hour increments and will be recorded. The sessions are scheduled for:

**Airship Topics have not yet been assigned to sessions. To propose additional topics you may do so until the 23rd of
May on the [*agenda etherpad*](https://etherpad.opendev.org/p/airship-virtual-ptg-2020). Once the schedule is finalized
this blog post will be updated, and the schedule will be shared by e-mail distribution list.**

## **AIRSHIP USER SURVEY**

If you are evaluating or running Airship, share your feedback in the [*Airship User Survey*](
https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/YKZ9NC2)! This survey provides users an opportunity to provide anonymous feedback to
influence the community and software direction. By sharing information about your configuration and requirements, the
Airship Working Committee will be able to advocate on your behalf. The 2020 survey results will be presented at the Fall
Summit, November, 2020. Take the [*Airship User Survey*](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/YKZ9NC2) to be included in this
round of analysis.

## **UPCOMING AIRSHIP TECHNICAL COMMITTEE ELECTION**

The Airship community adopted formal [*governance*](https://opendev.org/airship/governance) in 2019 leading to the
creation of two committees responsible for helping to guide Airship projects. Each of these committees is elected by
the community to serve for one year at a time.

Next month, in June, the current Technical Committee term will end, and elections to fill all 5 seats for the 2020-2021
Technical Committee term will be held.

Anyone who has demonstrated a commitment to Airship (community building, communications, or had code merged to the
Airship project repositories) within the last 12 months is eligible to run for the Technical Committee. Anyone who is a
Contributor (someone who has had changes merged within the last 12 months to any Airship project repository) before the
election will be eligible to vote for the TC candidates. There are no term limits, but in order to encourage diversity,
no more than 2 of the 5 seats can be filled by any one organization. The Technical Committee will meet regularly in an
open forum with times and locations published in community channels.

For more details for eligibility, responsibilities, and election processes please see the [*Airship Governance*](
https://opendev.org/airship/governance).
