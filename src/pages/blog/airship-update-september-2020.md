  Airship as the tool used to deploy all of the operator's network cloud deployments running their 5G workloads.

## **AIRSHIP BLOG**

The Airship blog is a great way to keep up with what's going on in the community. The Airship community publishes
[_blog posts_](https://www.airshipit.org/blog/) regularly, including the Airship 2.0 Blog series. These blog posts
introduce the changes from Airship 1.0 to Airship 2.0, highlight new features, and detail each component's evolution.
The recommended reading order for these blogs is listed below. It begins with the lessons learned on the road to Alpha,
to address the changes made from the original blog series 1-6.

## **AIRSHIP MEETING UPDATES**

Each year the Airship community elects a new Technical and Working Committee, and new members to the Technical and
Committee bring fresh ideas with them. Last month, in August, The new Working Committee met to discuss ways the current
meeting agenda to ensure the scheduled times, frequency, and subject matter were providing value to the Airship
Community in the best way possible.

Results of these discussions led to changes in two meetings:

**Airship SIG UI**

This meeting, previously scheduled on Fridays, has been discontinued for 2020. Airship UI design topics have will now be
discussed during Airship Open Design meetings. Grooming sessions for Airship UI will now occur during the Airship Flight
Plan Call. Please see the original announcement [here](
http://lists.airshipit.org/pipermail/airship-discuss/2020-September/001085.html).

<br>

**Airship Slack/IRC meeting**

This meeting, previously scheduled every Tuesday, has been changed to a bi-weekly schedule. Please see the original
announcement [here](http://lists.airshipit.org/pipermail/airship-discuss/2020-August/001080.html).

<br>

Please take a moment to review the [Wiki](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Airship#Get_in_Touch) for all of Airship's
sessions.

## **PROJECT TEAMS GATHERING (PTG) OCTOBER 2020**

The Project Teams Gathering (PTG) is an event organized by the OpenStack Foundation. It provides meeting facilities
allowing the various OSF project teams (user workgroups, development teams, operators, SIGs) to meet in-person,
exchange, and get work done in a productive setting. It lets those various groups discuss their priorities for the
upcoming cycle, assign work items, iterate quickly on solutions for complex problems, and make fast progress on critical
issues. The co-location of those various meetings, combined with the event's dynamic scheduling, makes it easy to get
specific people in the same room to discuss a particular topic or participate in multiple team meetings. Evenings allow
for relationship building and problem sharing.

<br>

[_Register for free_](https://october2020ptg.eventbrite.com/), and make sure to mark your calendar for October 26 - 30.

## **AIRSHIP USER SURVEY**

Are you evaluating Airship or using Airship in production? We want to learn from your experience! Take the [_Airship
User Survey_](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/YKZ9NC2); the Working Committee reviews each response and helps us to grow
and mature Airship. We will present the 2020 survey results at the Fall Summit in October. Take the [_Airship User
Survey_](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/YKZ9NC2) today to be included in this round of analysis.
