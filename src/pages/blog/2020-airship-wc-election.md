The Airship team is excited to announce the completion of its second [_Working Committee election_](
***PLACEHOLDER LINK***)! The [_Working Committee_](
https://opendev.org/airship/governance#user-content-working-committee), one of the two governing bodies for Airship,
is responsible for defining the project core principles, performing marketing and communications and helping to provide
product management and ecosystem support.

The Airship Working Committee is composed of five elected members, representing leaders from ***NUMBER*** different companies:

* WC member, Company
* WC member, Company
* WC member, Company

We want to extend our congratulations to the new Working Committee members and recognize the contributions of Ian
Pittwood, Nishant Kumar, and Stanislav Egorov to the Airship Community through their roles on the Working Committee last
year. Governance by community-elected officials reflects Airship's continued dedication to the [_Four Opens_](
https://osf.dev/four-opens/). The Working Committee is organizing its schedule for the upcoming year. Once finalized,
the Working Committee will share the meeting schedule for 2020-2021 on the [_Wiki_](
https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Airship/Airship-WC), where previous meeting agendas and recordings are also available.

a Bottle_](https://opendev.org/airship/treasuremap/src/branch/master/tools/deployment/aiab), attending one of the
[_weekly meetings_](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Airship#Get_in_Touch), and [_getting involved with development_](
