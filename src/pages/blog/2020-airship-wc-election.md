The Airship team is excited to announce the completion of its second [_Working Committee election_](
http://lists.airshipit.org/pipermail/airship-discuss/2020-August/001062.html)! The [_Working Committee_](
https://opendev.org/airship/governance#user-content-working-committee), one of the two governing bodies for Airship,
is responsible for defining the project core principles, performing marketing and communications, and providing
product management and ecosystem support.

The Airship Working Committee is composed of five elected members, representing leaders from four different companies:

* Drew Walters, AT&T
* James Gu, Insight Global
* Kostiantyn Kalynovskyi, Mirantis
* Matt McEuen, AT&T
* Sreejith Punnapuzha, Ericsson

<br>

We want to extend our congratulations to the new Working Committee members and recognize the contributions of Ian
Pittwood, Nishant Kumar, and Stanislav Egorov to the Airship Community through their roles on the Working Committee last
year. Governance by community-elected officials reflects Airship's continued dedication to the [_Four Opens_](
https://osf.dev/four-opens/). The Working Committee is organizing its schedule for the upcoming year. Once finalized,
the Working Committee will share the meeting schedule for 2020-2021 on the [_Wiki_](
https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Airship/Airship-WC). Previous meeting agendas and recordings are also available on the
[_Wiki_](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Airship/Airship-WC).

Please visit the [_Airship website_](https://www.airshipit.org) for more information about how Airship can manage
infrastructure deployments and lifecycle. There's a wealth of information about how to get started using [_Airship in a
Bottle_](https://opendev.org/airship/treasuremap/src/branch/master/tools/deployment/aiab), attending one of the
[_weekly meetings_](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Airship#Get_in_Touch), and [_getting involved with development_](
