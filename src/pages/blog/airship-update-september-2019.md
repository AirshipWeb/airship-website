Welcome to the Airship Community Update, a digest of the latest developments and activities across Airship projects, events, and users! One goal of the Airship Technical Committee is to help build community, and so we hope by keeping you informed of project milestones and news, we will make it easier for you to get involved when the time is right. If you wish to be removed from this distribution, please just respond as such.<!-- more -->

## **SPOTLIGHT ON ....**

- Welcome to Dell Technologies, who has joined the Airship community and is starting development and other contributions to Airship 2.0. [*The Dell Press Release*](https://corporate.delltechnologies.com/en-us/newsroom/announcements/detailpage.press-releases~usa~2019~08~20180815-opensource-edge-computing-and-5g-software-infrastructure.htm#/filter-on/Country:en-us).

- Congratulations to the newly elected Airship Working Committee:
  * Drew Walters
  * Kaspars Skels
  * Matt McEuen
  * Nishant Kumar

  The Working Committee helps influence the project strategy, arbitrate when there is a disagreement between Core Reviewers within a single project or between Airship projects, define the project core principles, and perform marketing and communications. The committee also helps provide product management and ecosystem support.

- Cheers to the Airship community for initiating the work and making tremendous progress in the 1st Airship Sprint, 201908-Bootstrapping. The community made great progress on the bootstrap plugin which generates a custom ISO file targeting a bootstrap host. It also remotely configures ephemeral bootstrap host using Redfish so that it can bootstrap with the custom ISO image. The next Sprint is 201909-Cluster-Deployment to deploy a target cluster with initial control plane servers and manage the lifecycle of cluster.

## **AIRSHIP BLOG**

The Airship blog is a great way to keep up with what's going on in the community. The Airship community publishes
[*blog posts*](https://www.airshipit.org/blog/) regularly, including the recent Airship 2.0 Blog series. These blog
posts introduce the changes from Airship 1.0 to Airship 2.0, highlight new features, and detail the evolution of each
component. The first six Airship 2.0 Blog posts are already available:

_**UPDATE 03-August-2020:** Airship 2.0 development spans multiple milestones. Upon completing the first major
milestone, Alpha, the community took some time to reflect on lessons learned and how they impacted the direction and
design of Airship 2.0. We have summarized these lessons learned and how the design has changed over time - including
using different technologies and approaches. You can read more about these changes here: [Airship 2.0 is Alpha - Lessons
Learned](https://www.airshipit.org/blog/airship2-is-alpha/). You should review these changes before reading blogs posted
before the Airship 2.0 beta milestone._
