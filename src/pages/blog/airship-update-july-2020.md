## **SPOTLIGHT ON...**

- Last month the community elected the 2020-2021 Technical Committee. For more information, check out this blog
  [_post_](https://www.airshipit.org/blog/2020-airship-tc-election/).

## **AIRSHIP BLOG**

The Airship blog is a great way to keep up with what's going on in the community. The Airship community publishes
[_blog posts_](https://www.airshipit.org/blog/) regularly, including the new Airship 2.0 Blog series. These blog posts
introduce the changes from Airship 1.0 to Airship 2.0, highlight new features, and detail each component's evolution.
The first six Airship 2.0 Blog posts are already available, and illustrate the design thoughts on the road to the alpha
milestone:

_**UPDATE 03-August-2020:** Airship 2.0 development spans multiple milestones. Upon completing the first major
milestone, Alpha, the community took some time to reflect on lessons learned and how they impacted the direction and
design of Airship 2.0. We have summarized these lessons learned and how the design has changed over time - including
using different technologies and approaches. You can read more about these changes here: [Airship 2.0 is Alpha - Lessons
Learned](https://www.airshipit.org/blog/airship2-is-alpha/). You should review these changes before reading blogs posted
before the Airship 2.0 beta milestone._

This election will follow the same two-week cycle that the Technical Committee election followed last month.

Anyone who has had changes merged within the last 12 months to an Airship project is eligible to run for the Working
Committee. Anyone who is a Core Reviewer of any Airship Project before the election will be eligible to vote for the WC
candidates. There are no term limits, but any organization can fill no more than two of the five seats to encourage
diversity. The Working Committee will meet regularly in an open forum with times and locations published in community

User Survey_](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/YKZ9NC2); the Working Committee reviews each response and helps us to grow
and mature Airship. We will present the 2020 survey results at the Fall Summit in November. Take the [_Airship User
