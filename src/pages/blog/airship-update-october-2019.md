What follows is the Airship Community Update for the month of October, 2019, brought to you by the Airship Technical Committee.<!-- more -->

## **SPOTLIGHT ON ....**

- **Breaking News**: Airship has exited the pilot phase and has been confirmed by the OpenStack Foundation as an official project. Thank you to all community members for your efforts over the last 2 years that have led to this significant milestone.

- The Software research team within Standards &Technology at Ericsson kicked off a collaboration with Airship community to leverage Airship as a container platform enabling their beyond 5G testbed R&D efforts. It is expected that this collaboration will result in the introduction of Multus and other new integrations with Airship.

- Congratulations to the Airship community for making significant progress in Airship 2.0. 17% of planned work was completed, another 18% is in progress and/or in review. The community is looking for more developers to contribute code.

- **Tip of the month**: [A Quick and Dirty Guide to Airship in a Bottle](https://www.mirantis.com/blog/airship-in-a-bottle-quick-dirty-guide)

  Airship is designed to enable you to reliably deploy OpenStack on Kubernetes, but with both of those systems being complicated to deploy, a system that combines them can be downright confusing. Fortunately, the community has created Airship in a Bottle, a simple way to create a deployment so you can get an idea of what's going on.

## **AIRSHIP BLOG**

The Airship blog is a great way to keep up with what's going on in the community. The Airship community publishes
[*blog posts*](https://www.airshipit.org/blog/) regularly, including the recent Airship 2.0 Blog series. These blog
posts introduce the changes from Airship 1.0 to Airship 2.0, highlight new features, and detail the evolution of each
component. The first six Airship 2.0 Blog posts are already available:

_**UPDATE 03-August-2020:** Airship 2.0 development spans multiple milestones. Upon completing the first major
milestone, Alpha, the community took some time to reflect on lessons learned and how they impacted the direction and
design of Airship 2.0. We have summarized these lessons learned and how the design has changed over time - including
using different technologies and approaches. You can read more about these changes here: [Airship 2.0 is Alpha - Lessons
Learned](https://www.airshipit.org/blog/airship2-is-alpha/). You should review these changes before reading blogs marked
as "Pre-Alpha."_
