## **AIRSHIP BLOG**

The Airship blog is a great way to keep up with what's going on in the community. The Airship community publishes
[_blog posts_](https://www.airshipit.org/blog/) regularly, including the Airship 2.0 Blog series. These blog posts
introduce the changes from Airship 1.0 to Airship 2.0, highlight new features, and detail each component's evolution.
The recommended reading order for these blogs is listed below. It begins with the lessons learned on the road to Alpha
to address the changes made from the original blog series 1-6.

- [*Airship 2.0 is Alpha - Lessons Learned*](https://www.airshipit.org/blog/airship2-is-alpha/)
- [*Pre-Alpha Airship Blog Series 1 - Evolution Towards 2.0*](
  https://www.airshipit.org/blog/pre-alpha-airship-blog-series-1-evolution-towards-2.0/)

## **AIRSHIP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT**

Each year the Open Infrastructure Foundation (OIF) provides an annual report to the community, including project
developments, foundation news, and letters from the Executive Director. You can find the 2020 OIF report [_here_](
https://www.openstack.org/annual-reports/2020-openinfra-foundation-annual-report/).

The Airship project began issuing its annual reports, included in the yearly OIF report, at the end of 2019. The 2019
Airship Annual Report is available [_here_](https://www.airshipit.org/blog/a-year-in-review-getting-confirmed-and-looking-ahead-to-2-0/).

Last month Drew Walters authored the [_Airship 2020 Annual Report_](https://www.airshipit.org/blog/airship-2020-annual-report/).
I encourage you to read the full report; a few of the highlights you'll find include:

* Airship 2.0 GA Status
* Airship designated as a Certified Kubernetes Distribution
* Community metrics
* Cloud Infrastructure Telco Taskforce (CNTT) updates

## **COMMUNITY MEETING AGENDAS**

Since the Airship IRC weekly meeting changed from a weekly schedule to a biweekly meeting schedule, The Working
Committee thought it would be helpful to change the agenda etherpad to an easier to remember URL. Instead of having an
etherpad for each meeting date, there is now a single etherpad for all IRC meetings. The Airship Technical and
Working Committee meetings also have an irregular meeting schedule (monthly and biweekly, respectively) and have adopted
the same standard etherpad format.

You can find the updated etherpads below:
* [_Airship IRC Team Meeting_](https://etherpad.opendev.org/p/airship-team-meeting)
* [_Airship Technical Committee Meeting_](https://etherpad.opendev.org/p/airship-tc-meeting)
* [_Airship Working Committee Meeting_](https://etherpad.opendev.org/p/airship-wc-meeting)

<br>

## **AIRSHIP USER SURVEY**

Are you evaluating Airship or using Airship in production? We want to learn from your experience! Take the [_Airship
User Survey_](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/YKZ9NC2); the Working and Technical Committees review each response to grow
and mature Airship. Take the [_Airship User Survey_](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/YKZ9NC2) today to be
included in the next round of analysis.
