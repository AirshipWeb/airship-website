The Airship team is excited to announce the completion of its second [_Technical Committee election_](
http://lists.airshipit.org/pipermail/airship-discuss/2020-June/001005.html)! The [_Technical Committee_](
https://opendev.org/airship/governance#user-content-technical-committee), one of the two governing bodies for Airship,
is responsible for ensuring Airship projects adhere to the project's core principles, promote standardization, and
define and organize the Airship versioning and release process.

The Airship Technical Committee is composed of five elected members, representing leaders from five different companies:

* Alex Bailey, AT&T
* Alexander Hughes, Accenture
* Alexey Odinokov, Mirantis
* Jan-Erik MÃ¥ngs, Ericsson
* John (JT) Williams, Dell

<br>

We want to extend our congratulations to the new Technical Committee members and recognize the contributions of Andrew
Leasck, James Gu, and Ryan van Wyk to the Airship Community through their roles on the Technical Committee last year.
Governance by community-elected officials reflects Airship's continued dedication to the [_Four Opens_](
https://osf.dev/four-opens/). The Technical Committee is organizing its schedule for the upcoming year. Once finalized,
the Technical Committee will share the meeting schedule for 2020-2021 on the [_Wiki_](
https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Airship/Airship-TC), where previous meeting agendas and recordings are also available.

With the Technical Committee election wrapped up, the Airship community has now turned their attention to the Working
Committee election. The [_Working Committee_](https://opendev.org/airship/governance#user-content-working-committee)
guides the project strategy, helps arbitrate when there is a disagreement between Core Reviewers within a single project
or between Airship projects, defines the project core principles, performs marketing and communications, and finally
helps provide product management and ecosystem support.

Nominations and elections for the Working Committee will take place next month. Anyone who has had changes merged to an
Airship project within the last 12 months is qualified to run for the Working Committee. Airship project core reviewers
will be eligible to vote on the nominees.

Please visit the [_Airship website_](https://www.airshipit.org) for more information about how Airship can manage
infrastructure deployments and lifecycle. There's a wealth of information about how to get started by using [_Airship in
a Bottle_](https://opendev.org/airship/treasuremap/src/branch/master/tools/deployment/aiab), attending one of the
[_weekly meetings_](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Airship#Get_in_Touch), and [_getting involved with development_](
