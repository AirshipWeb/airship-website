## **AIRSHIP BLOG**

The Airship blog is a great way to keep up with what's going on in the community. The Airship community publishes
[_blog posts_](https://www.airshipit.org/blog/) regularly, including the Airship 2.0 Blog series. These blog posts
introduce the changes from Airship 1.0 to Airship 2.0, highlight new features, and detail each component's evolution.
The recommended reading order for these blogs is listed below. It begins with the lessons learned on the road to Alpha
to address the changes made from the original blog series 1-6.

* [_Airship 2.0 is Alpha - Lessons Learned_](https://www.airshipit.org/blog/airship2-is-alpha/)
* [_Pre-Alpha Airship Blog Series 1 - Evolution Towards 2.0_](https://www.airshipit.org/blog/pre-alpha-airship-blog-series-1-evolution-towards-2.0/)
* [_Pre-Alpha Airship Blog Series 2 - An Educated Evolution_](https://www.airshipit.org/blog/pre-alpha-airship-blog-series-2-an-educated-evolution/)
* [_Pre-Alpha Airship Blog Series 3 - Airship 2.0 Architecture High Level_](https://www.airshipit.org/blog/pre-alpha-airship-blog-series-3-airship-2.0-architecture-high-level/)
* [_Pre-Alpha Airship Blog Series 4 - Shipyard - an Evolution of the Front Door_](https://www.airshipit.org/blog/pre-alpha-airship-blog-series-4-shipyard-an-evolution-of-the-front-door/)
* [_Pre-Alpha Airship Blog Series 5 - Drydock and Its Relationship to Cluster API_](https://www.airshipit.org/blog/pre-alpha-airship-blog-series-5-drydock-and-its-relationship-to-cluster-api/)
* [_Pre-Alpha Airship Blog Series 6 - Armada Growing Pains_](https://www.airshipit.org/blog/pre-alpha-airship-blog-series-6-armada-growing-pains/)

## **APRIL PROJECT TEAMS GATHERING (PTG)**

Save the date! The OpenInfra Foundation is hosting a virtual PTG the week of April 19-23!

The PTG allows the various OpenInfra project teams (user workgroups, development teams, operators, SIGs)
to meet virtually, exchange, and get work done in a productive setting. It lets those various groups discuss their
priorities for the upcoming cycle, assign work items, iterate quickly on solutions for complex problems, and make fast
progress on critical issues. The co-location of those various meetings, combined with the event's dynamic scheduling,
makes it easy to get specific people in the same virtual room to discuss a specific topic or participate in multiple
team meetings.

Make sure to sign up [_here_](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/project-teams-gathering-april-2021-tickets-143360351671) for
free!

**The Airship PTG sessions are planned for the following dates/times:**

* Thursday 22-April 0800-1200 CDT (1300-1700 UTC)
* Friday 23-April 0800-1200 CDT (1300-1700 UTC)
* Agenda: https://etherpad.opendev.org/p/xena-ptg-airship

<br>

Please make sure you either subscribe to the [_Airship Discuss_](http://lists.airshipit.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo)
mailing list or check back in late March for the official PTG schedule
[_here_](https://www.openstack.org/ptg/#tab_schedule).

## **DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME MEETING IMPACT**

On **March 14th**, Daylight Saving Time in the United States began. Airship community meetings are scheduled in US
Central Time, so those who do not observe Daylight Saving Time meetings moved forward by an hour beginning
**March 15th**. Please keep an eye on the [_mailing list_](http://lists.airshipit.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/airship-discuss) and the [_wiki_](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Airship) for updated meeting times!

<br>

## **BLOG SCHEDULE**

For nearly 18 months, the Airship [_Technical Committee_](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Airship/Airship-TC) has
provided monthly community updates in this blog and an e-mail newsletter. The Technical Committee met
earlier [_this month_](https://etherpad.opendev.org/p/airship-tc-meeting) and agreed to reduce the monthly update frequency to
quarterly updates or as needed for major announcements. To that end, this will be the last of the monthly project
updates until Q2. We have several exciting technical blogs planned to look forward to, including:

* Airship 2 General Availability
* Deep dive on Airship phases
* Deep dive on CaaS projects [_ViNO_](https://opendev.org/airship/vino) and [_SIP_](https://opendev.org/airship/sip)

<br>

## **AIRSHIP USER SURVEY**

Are you evaluating Airship or using Airship in production? We want to learn from your experience! Take the [_Airship
User Survey_](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/YKZ9NC2); the Working and Technical Committees review each response to grow
and mature Airship. Take the [_Airship User Survey_](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/YKZ9NC2) today to be
included in the next round of analysis.
