## **SPOTLIGHT ON...**

  that details the OpenDev community's investment in open source bare metal provisioning. On 22-July at the
  [_OpenDev: Hardware Automation_](https://www.openstack.org/events/opendev-2020/opendev-schedule-2)
  event, the [_Baremetal White Paper_](
  https://www.openstack.org/bare-metal/how-ironic-delivers-abstraction-and-automation-using-open-source-infrastructure)
  was announced. Catch up on the event recordings, agenda, and the Airship Case Study in this [_blog post_](

## **AIRSHIP BLOG**

The Airship blog is a great way to keep up with what's going on in the community. The Airship community publishes
[_blog posts_](https://www.airshipit.org/blog/) regularly, including the Airship 2.0 Blog series. These blog posts
introduce the changes from Airship 1.0 to Airship 2.0, highlight new features, and detail each component's evolution.
The recommended reading order for these blogs is listed below. It begins with the lessons learned on the road to Alpha,
to address the changes made from the original blog series 1-6.

## **OPEN INFRASTRUCTURE SUMMIT OCTOBER 2020**

## **PROJECT TEAMS GATHERING (PTG) OCTOBER 2020**

The Project Teams Gathering (PTG) is an event organized by the OpenStack Foundation. It provides meeting facilities
allowing the various OSF project teams (user workgroups, development teams, operators, SIGs) to meet in-person, exchange
and get work done in a productive setting. It lets those various groups discuss their priorities for the upcoming cycle,
assign work items, iterate quickly on solutions for complex problems, and make fast progress on critical issues. The
co-location of those various meetings, combined with the dynamic scheduling of the event, make it easy to get specific
people in the same room to discuss a specific topic, or participate in multiple team meetings. Evenings allow for
relationship building and problem sharing.

<br>

[_Register for free_](https://october2020ptg.eventbrite.com/) and make sure to mark your calendar for October 26 - 30.

and mature Airship. We will present the 2020 survey results at the Fall Summit in October. Take the [_Airship User
