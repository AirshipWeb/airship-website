## **SPOTLIGHT ON...**

- The community completed the Airship 2.0 beta milestone! The team is now working towards a General Availability (GA)
  release!

<br>

## **DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME**

On **November 01**, Daylight Saving Time in the United States will end. Airship community meetings are scheduled in US
Central Time, so those who do not observe Daylight Saving Time meetings will be moved back by an hour beginning
**November 02**. Please keep an eye on the [*mailing list*](
http://lists.airshipit.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/airship-discuss) and the [*wiki*](
https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Airship) for updated meeting times!

<br>

## **AIRSHIP BLOG**

The Airship blog is a great way to keep up with what's going on in the community. The Airship community publishes
[_blog posts_](https://www.airshipit.org/blog/) regularly, including the Airship 2.0 Blog series. These blog posts
introduce the changes from Airship 1.0 to Airship 2.0, highlight new features, and detail each component's evolution.
The recommended reading order for these blogs is listed below. It begins with the lessons learned on the road to Alpha,
to address the changes made from the original blog series 1-6.

## **OPEN INFRASTRUCTURE SUMMIT OCTOBER 2020**

The Open Infrastructure Summit will be going virtual, October 19 - 23, 2020.

The Summit is focused on open infrastructure integration. It has evolved over the years to cover more than 30 different
open source projects, including Airship, Ansible, Docker, Kata Containers, Kubernetes, OpenShift, OpenStack, StarlingX,
Zuul, and many more.

The Open Infrastructure Summit is structured around relevant use cases, training, and complementary open source
projects. Collaborate with people from more than 30 open source communities and meet the users, developers, and vendors
who build and operate open infrastructure.

<br>

**SUMMIT SCHEDULE**

The Summit will run for five days, Monday - Friday, October 19 - 23:
- Comprised of presentations, panels, workshops, and educational opportunities
- Tracks include CI/CD, Container Infrastructure, Hands-On Workshops, AI, Machine Learning, HPC, Open Development,
  Private & Hybrid Cloud, Public Cloud, Security and 5G, NFV & Edge
- Keynote presentations from notable operators, developers, and industry leaders 

The full schedule is available for review [here](https://www.openstack.org/summit/2020/summit-schedule#day=2020-10-19).

October 19 - 23.

## **PROJECT TEAMS GATHERING (PTG) OCTOBER 2020**

The Project Teams Gathering (PTG) is an event organized by the OpenStack Foundation. It provides meeting facilities
allowing the various OSF project teams (user workgroups, development teams, operators, SIGs) to meet in-person,
exchange, and get work done in a productive setting. It lets those various groups discuss their priorities for the
upcoming cycle, assign work items, iterate quickly on solutions for complex problems, and make fast progress on critical
issues. The co-location of those various meetings, combined with the event's dynamic scheduling, makes it easy to get
specific people in the same room to discuss a particular topic or participate in multiple team meetings. Evenings allow
for relationship building and problem sharing.

<br>

[_Register for free_](https://october2020ptg.eventbrite.com/), and make sure to mark your calendar for October 26 - 30.

## **AIRSHIP USER SURVEY**

Are you evaluating Airship or using Airship in production? We want to learn from your experience! Take the [_Airship
User Survey_](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/YKZ9NC2); the Working Committee reviews each response and helps us to grow
and mature Airship. We will present the 2020 survey results at the Fall Summit in October. Take the [_Airship User
Survey_](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/YKZ9NC2) today to be included in this round of analysis.
