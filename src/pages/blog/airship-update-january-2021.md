## **AIRSHIP BLOG**

The Airship blog is a great way to keep up with what's going on in the community. The Airship community publishes
[_blog posts_](https://www.airshipit.org/blog/) regularly, including the Airship 2.0 Blog series. These blog posts
introduce the changes from Airship 1.0 to Airship 2.0, highlight new features, and detail each component's evolution.
The recommended reading order for these blogs is listed below. It begins with the lessons learned on the road to Alpha,
to address the changes made from the original blog series 1-6.

## **AIRSHIP 2 IS KUBERNETES CERTIFIED**

![](/images/kubernetes_certified.png)

Airship 2.0 has been designated as a Certified Kubernetes Distribution through the Cloud Native Computing Foundation's
[_Software Conformance Program_](https://www.cncf.io/certification/software-conformance/), guaranteeing that Airship
provides a consistent installation of Kubernetes, supports the latest Kubernetes versions, and provides a portable
cloud-native environment with other Certified Platforms.

This will appeal to users of Airship for a number of reasons, including:

- **Consistency** - a Certified Kubernetes product guarantees that the complete Kubernetes API functions as specified, so
  users can rely on a seamless, stable experience with any installation of Kubernetes.
- **Timely Updates** - to remain certified, Airship will need to provide the latest version of Kubernetes yearly (or more
  frequently), so you can be sure that you'll always have access to the latest features.
- **Confirmability** - any end user can confirm Airship remains conformant by running [_Sonobuoy_](https://sonobuoy.io/).
