# Airship website

This is the public repo to mantain the Airship website at [airshipit.org](airshipit.org).

## Overview

Airshipit.org is based on Vuepress + Netlify CMS.

Vuepress is a minimalistic Vue-powered static site generator. Netlify CMS is unique type of CMS that edits site content as static markdown files via git, but using a friendly and familair CMS interface. (CMS users do not have to use or understand git directly.) Bulma is used for CSS, extended with Buefy for lightweight UI components.

## File guidance

- Most pages can be found in `/site/` under their corresponding folder name. You can make changes to the `.md` file using markdown or html. The frontmatter must be YAML.
- Home page content can be found in `/index.md`, with the majority being editable in the frontmatter.
- Blog posts can be created by adding a markdown file to `/site/blog/`. Don't forget the frontmatter, including the title, author, date and category. For now, authors must match filenames under `/site/authors/`. For example `author: first-last` assumiing the filename is `first-last.md`.
- HTML for each templates can be found in `/site/.vuepress/components/` as `.vue` files.
- All CSS and Sass files are in `/site/.vuepress/theme/`
- Public images should be placed in `/site/.vuepress/public/images/` and can be referenced as `/images/filename`
- Header and footer navigation are stored in JSON. Header nav can be found at `/site/pages.json` and footer nav is at `/site/footer-nav.json`.
- We are storing public facing documents such as collateral and slide templates in `/site/.vuepress/public/` in the `collateral` and `templates` folders, respectively.
