## **SPOTLIGHT ON ....**

- Daylight Saving Time impact on community meetings. If you do not observe Daylight Saving Time please note that meeting
times are now one hour earlier than they were previously. For the current meeting list and their schedules check the
[*Airship Wiki*](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Airship#Get_in_Touch).

## **AIRSHIP BLOG**

The Airship blog is a great way to keep up with what's going on in the community. The Airship community publishes
[*blog posts*](https://www.airshipit.org/blog/) regularly, including the recent Airship 2.0 Blog series. These blog
posts introduce the changes from Airship 1.0 to Airship 2.0, highlight new features, and detail the evolution of each
component. The first six Airship 2.0 Blog posts are already available:

- [*Airship Blog Series 1 - Evolution Towards 2.0*](
