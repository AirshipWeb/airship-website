The Airship project is taking flight at the the upcoming [Open Infrastructure Summit in Denver](https://www.openstack.org/summit/denver-2019/), April 29 - May 1. Airship community members will join 30 other open source projects attending the Summit to collaborate on open infrastructure. If you want to be part of it too [register now](https://www.openstack.org/summit/denver-2019/) before prices increase on February 27.

For 2019, the Summit has expanded and rebranded from the OpenStack Summit to the Open Infrastructure Summit, reflecting the large number of open source tools used to automate modern infrastructure and the challenges of integrating them. The agenda for the event is now live and features more than 9 Airship talks. Congratulations to all of the presenters!
