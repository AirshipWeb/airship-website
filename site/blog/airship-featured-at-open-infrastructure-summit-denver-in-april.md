For 2019, the Summit has expanded and rebranded from the OpenStack Summit to the Open Infrastructure Summit, reflecting the large number of open source tools used to automate modern infrastructure and the challenges of integrating them. The agenda for the event is now live and features more than 9 Airship talks. Congratulations to all of the presenters!
