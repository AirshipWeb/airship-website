The Airship team is excited to announce the completion of its first [Technical
Committee election](http://lists.airshipit.org/pipermail/airship-discuss/2019-July/000514.html)
The [Technical Committee](https://opendev.org/airship/governance/src/branch/master/README.md#technical-committee),
one of the two governing bodies for Airship, is responsible for ensuring
Airship projects adhere to the project’s core principles, promote
standardization, and define and organize the Airship versioning and release
process. <!-- more -->

The complete slate of candidates represented six leaders from six
different companies, a reflection of the growth of the Airship project since it
was formally announced in early 2018. The Airship Technical Committee is
composed of five elected members:

* James Gu, SUSE
* Alexander Hughes, Accenture
* Jan-Erik Mångs, Ericsson
* Alexey Odinokov, Mirantis
* Ryan van Wyk, AT&T

We want to extend our congratulations to the new Technical Committee members,
and also say thanks to everyone who participated in the election. Governance by
community-elected officials is one of the cornerstones of the [Four
Opens](https://osf.dev/about/four-opens/), and is a major step forward in the
maturation of Airship. The Technical Committee is organizing its first meeting,
and will soon publish the schedule and agenda to the Airship mailing list.

The Technical Committee is just one of the two governing bodies within the
Airship community, and with that election wrapped up they have now turned their
attention to the Working Committee election. The [Working Committee](https://opendev.org/airship/governance/src/branch/master/README.md#working-committee)
guides the project strategy, helps arbitrate when there is a disagreement
between Core Reviewers within a single project or between Airship projects,
defines core project principles, assists in marketing and communications,
provides product management, and offers ecosystem support.

[Nominations for the Airship Working Committee](http://lists.airshipit.org/pipermail/airship-discuss/2019-July/000525.html)
are now open, and will remain open until [July 30, 19:00 UTC](http://lists.airshipit.org/pipermail/airship-discuss/2019-July/000535.html).
Anyone who has contributed to the Airship project within the last 12 months is
eligible to run for the Working Committee and vote in the upcoming election.
