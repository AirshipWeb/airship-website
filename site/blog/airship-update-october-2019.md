## **SPOTLIGHT ON ....**

- **Breaking News**: Airship has exited the pilot phase and has been confirmed by the OpenStack Foundation as an official project. Thank you to all community members for your efforts over the last 2 years that have led to this significant milestone.

- The Software research team within Standards &Technology at Ericsson kicked off a collaboration with Airship community to leverage Airship as a container platform enabling their beyond 5G testbed R&D efforts. It is expected that this collaboration will result in the introduction of Multus and other new integrations with Airship.

- Congratulations to the Airship community for making significant progress in Airship 2.0. 17% of planned work was completed, another 18% is in progress and/or in review. The community is looking for more developers to contribute code.

- **Tip of the month**: [A Quick and Dirty Guide to Airship in a Bottle](https://www.mirantis.com/blog/airship-in-a-bottle-quick-dirty-guide)

  Airship is designed to enable you to reliably deploy OpenStack on Kubernetes, but with both of those systems being complicated to deploy, a system that combines them can be downright confusing. Fortunately, the community has created Airship in a Bottle, a simple way to create a deployment so you can get an idea of what's going on.

## **THE AIRSHIP BLOG**

The Airship blog is a great way to keep up with what's going on in the community. The Airship community publishes [blog posts](https://www.airshipit.org/blog/) regularly, including the recent:

- [Airship 2.0 Blog Series 4 "Shipyard - an Evolution of the Front Door"](https://www.airshipit.org/blog/airship-blog-series-4-shipyard-an-evolution-of-the-front-door.html): Shipyard provides a frontend API within Airship environments that allows users to push their declared documents into sites and execute pre-defined Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) against those declarations. DAG is a directed graph data structure for topological ordering. From an architectural perspective, this is what Shipyard looks like today and how it interacts with other Airship components.

- [Airship 2.0 Blog Series #5 "Drydock and Its Relationship to Cluster API"](https://www.airshipit.org/blog/airship-blog-series-5-drydock-and-its-relationship-to-cluster-api.html): As part of the evolution of Airship 1.0, an enduring goal has remained supporting multiple provisioning backends beyond just bare metal. This includes those that can provision to third-party clouds and to other use cases like OpenStack VMs as well as enable you to bring your own infrastructure.
